# Simple Tic Tac Toe

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe. The game is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## How to play

The game is played in the browser. The game board is a 3x3 grid, and the players take turns marking a square on the grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all of the squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

## How to run

To run the game, open the file `index.html` in a web browser.

## How to build

The game is built using the Vite build tool. To build the game, run the command `npm run build` in the terminal. This will create a production-ready build of the game in the `dist` directory.

## How to contribute

Contributions are welcome! To contribute to the game, fork the repository, make your changes, and then submit a pull request.
